TEOS-10 V3.03 GSW Oceanographic Toolbox in C

This is a translation of the original Fortran-90 source code into C.
You should download the documentation from http://teos-10.org.
The functions gsw_saar and gsw_deltasa_atlas have been modified from the
original to not use an external data file for global absolute salinity
anomaly and absolute salinity anomaly ratio data. The data are instead
incorporated into static variables that are used directly.

Manifest:

LICENSE                         -- GSW C software license
README                          -- This file.
gsw_check_functions.c           -- C implementation of the check functions
gsw_oceanographic_toolbox.c     -- The C GSW library less gsw_saar
gsw_saar.c                      -- gsw_saar and gsw_deltasa_atlas (modified)
gsw_saar_data.c                 -- static global absolute salinity anomaly data
                                   used by gsw_saar.c
gswteos-10.h                    -- GSW function prototypes
Makefile                        -- basic make file to build gsw_check_functions
                                   and libgswteos-10.so

Notes:

C programs using the GSW Oceanographic Toolbox should include the
supplied header file:

#include <gswteos-10.h>

You'll probably want to build gsw_oceanographic_toolbox.c, and gsw_saar.c
into a library. "make library" will attempt to build a shared library for
gcc/GNU Linux platforms.

The main reasons for implementing GSW TEOS-10 in C are performance and
accessibility (you can link to it), and this is necessarily system-dependent.
Our environment is GNU/Linux (CentOS/RHEL) and the support files are targeted
to this platform.
