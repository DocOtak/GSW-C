The file GNUmakefile is supplied for use on Linux/GNU systems. It has two
major purposes:

    * To build a zip archive of the distribution suitable for TEOS-10.org; and
    * To set up a versioned source distribution suitable for building source
      and binary RPMs on RedHat Enterprise and CentOS Linux systems.

The file libgswteos-10.spec.proto is used by GNUmakefile for the "new-rpm"
target to make libgswteos-10.spec which is the control file for rpmbuild.

The file gsw_data_v3_0.nc is a part of the Fortran-90 and Matlab releases.  We
generate gsw_saar_data.c and gsw_check_data.c from this file using the
supplied python scripts make_saar_data.py and make_check_data.py.
